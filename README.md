# SwedishLSdataset
This dataset is the first Lexical Simplification Dataset developed for Swedish as a part of the Bachelor's thesis in Cognitive Science at Link√∂ping University. It contains 150 quadruples of complex words sourced from the Swedish Kelly list, their corpus frequencies in the "BloggMix odat" corpus, replacements to the complex word sourced from SynLex and their corresponding word frequencies in the BloggMix corpus, and an example sentence from SALDO where the complex word is found. The human assessment of each quadruple is also inlcuded in the dataset (regarding quality, coverage, and complexity). For a thorough description of the collection, see [link_to_paper].
